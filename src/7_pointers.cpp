/**
For each value of type T , there exists a pointer to that value.
A pointer can be created using the * operator and the address of value can be
accessed using the & operator.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int i = 20; // A variable containing an integer
    int* iptr = &i; // A pointer that points to 'i'
    std::cout << iptr << std::endl; // Accessing the address stored in the pointer
    std::cout << *iptr << std::endl; // Accessing the value that the pointer points to
    i = 30;
    std::cout << *iptr << std::endl; // derefrencing the pointer reflects the change made in th
    *iptr = 50; // pointer variables can be used to change the value
    std::cout << *iptr << std::endl; // Accessing the changed value
}
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The variable holding the
array is actually a pointer pointing to the array.

intArray[i]
is equivalent to,
*(intArray + i)

intArray itself holds the address for the zeroth index of the array. Hence,
intArray + i gives us the pointer to the i-th index. Then, the pointer is simply
dereferenced to obtain the value. All of this happens when we use the []
brackets for indexing.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int intArray[] = {15, 30, 45, 60};
    std::cout << intArray[2] << std::endl;
    std::cout << *(intArray + 2) << std::endl;
}

Dynamic memory :
Pointers donâ€™t always have to point to an existing value. They can be used to
create values and arrays in dynamic memory, which is really helpful during
runtime.
To create dynamic data using pointers, we must use the new keyword. The
type of the pointer and the value must be the same.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
#include <iostream>
int main(){
    float* fltPtr = new float(50.505); // A float has been created in dynamic memory
    std::cout << *fltPtr << std::endl;
    int* intArray = new int[10]; // A dynamic array of size 10 has been created
    intArray[0] = 20;
    std::cout << intArray[0] << std::endl;
}

Null Pointer:
Before C++11, 0 was often used to represent an empty or null value when the
NULL macro was not applicable. The issue with the literal 0 is that it can be
the null pointer (void*)0 or the number 0 . This is defined by the context.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>
int main(){
    std::cout << std::endl;
    int a= 0;
    int* b= 0;
    auto c= 0;
    std::cout << typeid(c).name() << std::endl;
    auto res= a+b+c;
    std::cout << "res: " << res << std::endl;
    std::cout << typeid(res).name() << std::endl;
}
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The variable c is of type int , and the variable res is of type pointer to int :
int* . Pretty simple, right? The expression a+b+c in line 13 is pointer
arithmetic.An alternative is the NULL macro, but the issue is that it implicitly converts to
int .
* ! The new null pointer, nullptr , cleans up the ambiguity of the number 0 and the macro NULL . nullptr is of type std::nullptr_t .



Properties:
We can assign nullptr to arbitrary pointers. 
The pointer becomes a null pointer and points to no data.
We cannot dereference a nullptr .
A nullptr pointer can be compared with all other pointers.
A nullptr can be converted to all pointers. This also holds true for
pointers to class members.

* ? We cannot compare or convert a nullptr to an integral type.
There is one
exception to this rule. We can implicitly compare and convert a bool value
with a nullptr . 
*! Therefore, we can use a nullptr in a logical expression.


*! The simple rule is: Use nullptr instead of 0 or NULL . Still not convinced? Here is my final and strongest point.

Generic code:
*! The literal 0 and NULL show their true nature in generic code. Thanks to
template argument deduction, both literals are integral types in the function
template. There is no hint that both literals were null pointer constants.
The code below will give an error:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
template<class P >
void functionTemplate(P p){
    int* a= p;
}
int main(){
    int* a= 0;
    int* b= NULL;
    int* c= nullptr;
    functionTemplate(0);
    functionTemplate(NULL);
    functionTemplate(nullptr);
}
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
We can use 0 and NULL to initialize the int pointer in line 10 and 11, but if
we use the values 0 and NULL as arguments of the function template, the
compiler will loudly complain.
*! The compiler deduces 0 in the function template to type int ; it deduces NULL
*! to the type long int . But these observations will not hold true for nullptr .
*! The nullptr in lines 12 and 16 is of the type std::nullptr_t .
