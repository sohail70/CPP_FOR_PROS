Class Types
! Classes are data types encapsulating attributes and methods

C++ has several primitive classes such as integer, string, double, etc. Each type
has its own methods that allow us to perform certain operations.

For example, the length() method can be used to calculate the length of a
string.


class Account{
    public:
        Account(double b);
        void deposit(double amt);
        void withdraw(double amt);
        double getBalance() const;
    private:
        double balance;
};


Attributes #
Attributes are variables defined in the class body. The variable, balance , is an
attribute or data member since it stores data relevant to the class.


Methods #
The functions of a class are known as methods. Methods usually perform an
operation using the attributes of the class. We will discuss the public flag in a
bit.



Objects #
An object is an instance of a class.


! Classes help us create objects that have the same properties.

! Objects are concrete examples of a class that exist at run time.

Object instantiation #
Creating a class object is the same as creating a string or integer. We must
specify the class name, followed by the name of the variable.

Account account(100.0);

Here, we:
Create an object, account , of type Account .
Initialize the object.
When it is created, it is known to the compiler.



Accessing class members #
All public methods can be accessed from outside the class. This means that for
the Account class above, deposit() , withdraw() , etc. can be accessed directly
for each object.




! Each object will also have a balance attribute but it cannot be accessed
! directly since it is private. Only the methods of the class can use this data
! member.


! The . operator can be used to access the members of a class. In the case of
! object pointers, -> is used instead.


Account acc(200.0);
Account* accPtr = new Account(200.0);
acc.balance = 500.0;
// ERROR; balance is private
acc.deposit(200.0);
accPtr->balance = 500.0; // ERROR; balance is private
accPtr->deposit(200.0);


Note: Based on the access rights, the compiler decides whether access to
a class member is possible or not.


static attributes #
! A static, or class attribute, is an attribute shared by all instances of a
! class.


! Usually, each object generates its own copy of the classâ€™s attributes, i.e., the
! attributes of one object are independent of the attributes of another.
! This is not true for a static attribute. Only one instance of the attribute ispresent and shared among all the objects.
! Think of it as a global class variable.

! A static attribute can also be accessed without a class instance because it is
! part of the class, not the individual object. To access it, we can use the scope
! resolution operator, :: .

! Static class attributes can only be initialized outside the class.

class Account{
....
static int deposits;
};
int Account::deposits = 0;
