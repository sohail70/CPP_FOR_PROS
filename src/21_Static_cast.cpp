static_cast is the simplest casting operator and is used for simple
conversions.

!It can only perform all the conversions that are well-defined by the compiler. For example, a string to integer cast wonâ€™t work.

! It allows bidirectional conversion between related data types such as:
! pointer types in class hierarchies
! integrals and floating-point numbers
! integrals and enumerations

!static_cast cannot be used with polymorphic types.

!Unlike dynamic_cast , a static_cast is performed during compile time.

    a = b ; //upcast
