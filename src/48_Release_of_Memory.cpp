delete #
! The delete operator deallocates the memory allocated by the new operator.

Point* p = new Point(1.0, 2.0);
delete p;

! If the deleted object belongs to a type hierarchy, the destructor of the object
! and the destructors of all base classes will be automatically called. If the
! destructor of the base class is virtual, we can destroy the object with a pointer
! or reference to the base class.



! After the memory of the object is deallocated, further access to the object
! results in undefined behavior. We have to point the deleted objectâ€™s pointer of
! the object to a different object.

! Using delete to deallocate an object allocated with new[] will result
! in undefined behavior.



delete[] #
! We have to use the operator delete[] for the deallocation of a C array that
! was allocated with new[] .

Point* p = new Point[15];
delete[] p;

!In contrast to delete , delete[] calls all the destructors of the C array.

! Using delete[] to deallocate an object allocated object with new will result in an undefined behavior.
