Lists
C++ supports the linked list data structure and provides additional methods to improve the list's functionality.

! std::list is a doubled linked list. std::list needs the header <list> .

Although it has a similar interface to std::vector or std::deque , std::list is
quite different from both of them. Thatâ€™s due to its structure.

std::list makes the following points unique:
! It supports no random access.
! Accessing an arbitrary element is slow because we might have to iterate through the whole list.
! Adding or removing an element is fast, if the iterator points to the right place.
! If we add or remove an element, the iterator remains valid.

Because of its special structure, std::list has a few special methods.
Special methods of std::list #


Method                  Description
lis.merge(c)            Merges the sorted list c into the sorted list lis , so that lis remains sorted.
lis.merge(c, op)        Merges the sorted list c into the sorted list lis , so that lis remains sorted. Uses op as sorting criteria.
lis.remove(val)         Removes all elements from lis with value val .
lis.remove_if(pre)      Removes all elements from lis ,fulfilling the predicate pre .
lis.splice(pos, ... )   Splits the elements in lis before pos . The elements can be single elements, ranges or lists.
lis.unique()            Removes adjacent element with the same value.
lis.unique(pre)         Removes adjacent elements, fulfilling the predicate pre .
