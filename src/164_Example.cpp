Example #
This example demonstrates cyclic references when using std::shared_ptr.

Explanation #

In line 41 â€“ 47, due to the artificial scope, the lifetime of the mother, the
son, and the daughter are limited. In other words, mother , son , and
daughter go out of scope, and therefore the destructor of the class Mother
(line 10 - 12), Son (line 25 - 27), and Daughter (line 33 - 35) should
automatically be invoked.

We state should, because only the destructor of the class Daughter is
called.

The graphic of the source code shows that we have a cyclic reference of
std::shared_ptr between mother and son. Therefore, the reference
counter is always greater than 0, and the destructor will not
automatically be invoked.

That observation does not hold true for mother and daughter. If the
daughter goes out of scope, the reference counter of the std::shared_ptr
myMother (line 36) becomes 0 and the resource will automatically be
deleted.
