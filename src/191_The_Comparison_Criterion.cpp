This lesson talks about the rules followed by ordered associative containers when comparing the values inside
them.

! The default comparison criterion of the ordered associative containers is
! std::less . If we want to use a user-defined type as the key, we have to
! overload the operator < . Itâ€™s sufficient to overload the operator < for our data
! type because the C++ runtime compares, with the help of the relation (!
! (elem1<elem2 || elem2<elem1)) , two elements for equality.

We can specify the sorting criterion as a template argument that must
implement a strict weak ordering.

Strict weak ordering
Strict weak ordering for a sorting criterion on a set S is given if the
following requirements are met:
For every s from S it has to hold that s < s is not possible.

For all s1 and s2 from S it must hold: If s1 < s2 , then s2 < s1 is
not possible.

For all s1 , s2 and s3 with s1 < s2 and s2 < s3 the following must
hold: s1 < s3 .

For all s1 , s2 and s3 with s1 not comparable with s2 and s2 not
comparable with s3 the following must hold: s1 is not comparable
with s3 .



In contrast to the definition of the strict weak ordering, the usage of a
comparison criterion with strict weak ordering is a lot simpler for an
std::map .
