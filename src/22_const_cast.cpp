!const_cast allows us to remove or add the const or volatile property from a variable.


!const_cast is perhaps the most rarely used cast operator because it is undefined behavior to remove const or volatile from a variable if the variable was declared const or volatile in the first place.

!This sort of behavior creates a discrepancy in the code since two pointers of different types are pointing to the same variable. Hence, itâ€™s better to avoid such a practice.

int main()
{
    int i{2011};
    //const_cast is being used to cast an integer reference to const int so that it can be assigned to the constI pointer.
    const int* constI = const_cast<const int*>(&i); // A const int pointer for an int
    //We can see the opposite happening in line 10 where const_cast is being used to remove the const property of the constI pointer.
    int* nonConstI = const_cast<int*>(constI); //Casting to an int pointer  
    *nonConstI = 9000;

    std::cout<<typeid(constI).name()<<"\n";
    std::cout<<typeid(nonConstI).name()<<"\n";
