The unordered associative containers store their indices in buckets. In which
bucket the index goes depends on the hash function, which maps the key to
the index. If different keys are mapped to the same index, itâ€™s called a
collision. The hash function tries to avoid this.

Indices are typically stored in the bucket as a linked list. Since the access to
the bucket is constant, the access to the linked list in the bucket is linear. The
number of buckets is called capacity, the average number of elements for each
bucket is called the load factor. In general, the C++ runtime generates new
buckets if the load factor is greater than 1. This process is called rehashing and
can also be triggered explicitly:

With the method max_load_factor , you can read and set the load factor in
order to influence the probability of collisions and rehashing. I want to
emphasize one point in the short example above: the key 500 is in the 5th
bucket at first, but after rehashing, it is in the 500th bucket.
