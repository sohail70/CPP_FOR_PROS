/* PDF 36 : Constant Expressions: constexpr

Constant expressions #
! With constexpr , we can define an expression that can be evaluated at compile
! time. constexpr can be used for variables, functions, and user-defined types.
! An expression that is evaluated at compile time has a lot of advantages.



A constant expression:
can be evaluated at compile time
gives the compiler deep insight into the code
is implicitly thread-safe
can be constructed in the read-only memory (ROM-able)


constexpr - variables and objects #
If we declare a variable as constexpr , the compiler will evaluate it at compile
time. This holds true not only for built-in types but also for instantiations of
user-defined types. There are a few serious restrictions for objects in order to
evaluate them at compile time.

To make our lives easier, we will use types built into the C++ library like bool ,
char , int , and double . We will call the remaining data types user-defined
data types. These are all std::string types. User-defined types typically hold
built-in types.


Variables #
By using the keyword, constexpr , a variable can be made a constant
expression

constexpr double myDouble= 5.2;

Therefore, we can use the variable in contexts that require a constant
expression, e.g., defining the size of an array. This has to be done at compile
time.
For the declaration of a constexpr variable, we have to keep a few rules in
mind.
! The variable:
    ! is implicitly const .
    ! has to be initialized.
    ! requires a constant expression for initialization.
!The rules make sense. If we evaluate a variable at compile-time, the variable
!can only depend on values that can be evaluated at compile time.


User-Defined types #
Objects are created by the invocation of the constructor. The constructor has a
few special rules.
! A constexpr constructor:
    ! can only be invoked with constant expressions.
    ! cannot use exception handling.
    ! has to be declared as default or delete or the function body must be empty (C++11).

!A constexpr user-defined type cannot have virtual base classes. It requires
!that each base object and each non-static member is initialized in the
!initialization list of the constructor, or directly in the class body. Consequently,
!it holds that each used constructor (e.g of a base class) has to be a constexpr
!constructor and that the applied initializers have to be constant expressions.


struct MyDouble{
    double myVal;
    constexpr MyDouble(double v): myVal(v){}
    constexpr double getVal(){return myVal;}
};

! The constructor has to be both empty and a constant expression.
! The user-defined type can have methods that may or may not be constant expressions.
! Instances of MyDouble can be instantiated at compile time.

Functions #
! constexpr functions are functions that have the potential to run at compile
! time. This means we can perform a lot of calculations at compile time, with
! the results available at runtime and stored as a constant in the ROM. In
! addition, constexpr functions are implicitly inline .

! A constexpr function can be invoked with a non- constexpr value. In this case,
! the function runs at runtime. A constexpr function is executed at compile-
! time when it is used in an expression that is evaluated at compile time (such
! as static_assert or the definition of a C-array) or when the result is
! requested at compile time:

constexpr auto res = constexprFunction()


For constexpr functions, there are a few restrictions:
! The function:
! has to be non-virtual.
! has to have arguments and a return value of a literal type. constexpr
! variables are of literal types.
! can only have one return statement.
! must return a value.
! will be executed at compile time if invoked within a constant expression.
! can only have a function body consisting of a return statement.
! must have a constant return value.
! is implicitly inline.


constexpr int fac(int n)
    {return n > 0 ? n * fac(n-1): 1;}
constexpr int gcd(int a, int b){
    return (b== 0) ? a : gcd(b, a % b);



Functions with C++14 #
The syntax of constexpr functions was massively improved with the change
from C++11 to C++14. In C++11, we had to remember which features we were
able to use in a constexpr function. 
! With C++14, we only have to remember which features we canâ€™t use in a constexpr function.

! constexpr functions in C++14:
!   can have variables that have to be initialized by a constant expression.
!   can have loops.
!   cannot have static or thread_local data.
!   can have conditional jump instructions or loop instructions.
!   can have more than one instruction.


Example: Magic of constexpr functions #
#include <iostream>
constexpr auto gcd(int a, int b){
    while (b != 0){
        auto t= b;
        b= a % b;
        a= t;
    }
    return a;
}

int main(){

    std::cout << std::endl;
    constexpr int i= gcd(11,121);

    int a= 11;
    int b= 121;
    int j= gcd(a,b);

    std::cout << "gcd(11,121): " << i << std::endl;
    std::cout << "gcd(a,b): " << j << std::endl;
    std::cout << std::endl;
}


The result of the variable i in line 16 and j in line 20 are calculated at
compile-time and runtime respectively. The compiler would complain when
we declare j as constexpr : constexpr int j = gcd(a, b) . The problem is that
int a , and int b are not constant expressions.


Pure functions #
! We can execute constexpr functions at runtime. If we use the return value of
! a constexpr function in a constant expression, the compiler will perform the
! function at compile time. So then, is there a reason to perform a constexpr
! function at runtime? Of course! You have the constexpr function so we can
! use it at runtime. But there is another, much more convincing reason.

! A constexpr function can potentially be performed at compile-time. There is
! no state at compile time, since we are in a pure functional sublanguage of the
! imperative programming language C++. In particular, this means that, at
! compile time, executed functions have to be pure functions. When we use this
! constexpr function at runtime the function stays pure.

! Pure functions are functions that always return the same result when given
! the same arguments. Pure functions are like infinitely large tables from which
! we get our value. The guarantee that an expression always returns the same
! result when given the same arguments is called referential transparency.

Advantages #


Pure functions have a lot of advantages:
!   The function call can be replaced by the result.
!   The execution of pure functions can automatically be distributed to other threads.
!   Function calls can be reordered.
!   They can easily be refactored.
The last three points hold true because pure functions have no state and
therefore have no dependency on the environment. Pure functions are often
called mathematical functions.There are a lot of good reasons to use constexpr functions. The table shows
the key points of pure and impure functions.

Pure functions:
1) Return always the same result when given the same argumnets.
2) Have never side effects
3) Never change the state of the program

Impure Functions:
1) May return a different result when given the same argumnets.
2) May have side effects.
3) May change the state of the program
