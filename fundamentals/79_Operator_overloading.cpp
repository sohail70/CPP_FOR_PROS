Operator Overloading

De nition #
C++ allows us to define the behavior of operators for our own data types. This
is known as operator overloading.

! Operators vary in nature and therefore, require different operands. The
! number of operands for a particular operator depends on:
! 1. the kind of operator (infix, prefix, etc.)
! 2. whether the operator is a method or function.

struct Account{
    Account& operator += (double b)
    {
        balance += b;
        return *this;
    }
    ...
}
...
Account a;
a += 100.0;



! We have already encountered function overloading. If the function is inside a
! class, it must be declared as a friend and all its arguments must be provided.

Rules #
To achieve perfect operator overloading, there is a large set of rules we have
to follow. Here are some of the important ones.

We cannot change the precedence of an operator. The compiler
computes all operators in order of precedence. We cannot alter this
order. Hence, whatever operation our operator performs, it will be
computed after the operator with higher precedence.

! Derived classes inherit all the operators of their base classes except
! the assignment operator. Each class needs to overload the = operator.

! All operators other than the function call operator cannot have
! default arguments.


! Operators can be called explicitly. A benefit of overloading an operator
! is that it can be used directly with its operands. However, the compiler
! may cause some implicit conversion in this process. We can make explicit
! calls to the overloaded operator in the following format: a.operator +=
! (b) .




//Example 1
#include<iostream>

class Account{

public:
    explicit Account(double b):balance(b){}

    Account& operator += (double b)
    {
        balance += b;
        return *this; //Me: return the updated version of the object
    }

    friend Account& operator+=(Account& a , Account& b);
    friend std::ostream& operator <<(std::ostream& os , const Account& a);

private:
    double balance;
};


Account& operator += (Account& a , Account& b)
{
    a.balance += b.balance;
    return a;
}

std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os , const Account& a)
{
    os<<a.balance;
    return os;
}

int main()
{
    Account acc1(100.0);
    Account acc2(100.0);
    Account acc3(100.0);

    acc1 += 50.0;
    acc1 += acc1;

    acc2 += 50.0;
    acc2 += acc2;

    acc3.operator+= (50.0);
    //acc3.operator+= (acc3); //Error

    std::cout<<acc1<<"\n";
    std::cout<<acc2<<"\n";
}


The += operator is being overloaded for the Account class in lines 8 to 10.
Now, we can add and assign a double to an Account object without any
problems. However, this will not support Account += Account , where both
operands are of the Account type.

For this purpose, we declare a friend function in line 13 to support the
additional assignment between two Account objects. The friend function
can access the private member, balance . Hence, we can perform
a.balance + b.balance . The function has been implemented in lines 21 to
24.

The << output operator has also been overloaded in a friend function on
lines 26 to 29. Now, std::cout << acc; will print the balance of the accobject.

From lines 39 to 43, we can see examples of the additional assignment
working between the Account and double types.

One thing to note is that the explicit operator call works when the
argument is a double , as seen in line 45.

! However, the call would not work for the Account argument in line 46.
! This is because the class doesnâ€™t support the conversion from Account to
! double .

Prohibited operators #
The following operators cannot be overloaded:
!    .
!    ::
!    ?:
!    sizeof
!    .*
!    typeof


Assignment operators #

! We can overload the assignment operator by implementing it as a copy or
! move assignment operator. It has to be implemented in a class method. The
! implementation is very similar to a copy or move constructor.

! If the assignment operator is not overloaded, the compiler creates one
! implicitly. This operator performs a member-wise assignment of all the values
! from the object to be assigned. This is very similar to the behavior of the copy
! constructor, except that instead of a new object being created, the members of
! an existing object are updated.



//Example 2

#include<algorithm>
#include<chrono>
#include<iomanip>
#include<iostream>


class Account{

public:
    Account() = default;
    Account(int numb): numberOf(numb), deposits(new double[numb]){}

    Account(const Account& other): numberOf(other.numberOf),deposits(new double [other.numberOf])
    {
        std::copy(other.deposits , other.deposits + other.numberOf , deposits);
    }

    Account& operator = (const Account& other)
    {
        numberOf = other.numberOf;
        deposits = new double [other.numberOf]; //ME: Now that you've allocated a memory you should copy the content by using the std::copy
        std::copy(other.deposits , other.deposits + other.numberOf , deposits);
        return *this;
    }

    Account(Account&& other): numberOf(other.numberOf) , deposits(other.deposits) //ME: when its && it means its ready to move
    {
        other.deposits = nullptr; //ME: After you moved you must make it null because this is move semantics
        other.numberOf = 0;
    }

    Account& operator = (Account&& other)
    {
        numberOf = other.numberOf;
        deposits = other.deposits;
        other.deposits = nullptr;
        other.numberOf = 0;
        return *this;
    }

private:
    int numberOf;
    double* deposits;

};

int main()
{
    std::cout<<std::fixed<<std::setprecision(10);

    Account account(200000000);
    Account account2(100000000);

    auto start = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
    
    account = account2;
    std::chrono::duration<double> dur = std::chrono::system_clock::now() - start;
    std::cout<<"Account& operator = (const Account& other): "<<dur.count()<<"\n";

    start = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
    account = std::move(account2);
    dur = std::chrono::system_clock::now() - start;
    std::cout<<"Account& operator=(Account&& other): "<<dur.count()<<"\n";
}

In this example, the assignment operator for the Account class is
overloaded for both copy (line 16) and move (line 27) operations.

! If the argument is an lvalue, a copy is performed. A new array on the
! heap is created, called deposits , and the contents of other 's array is
! copied into it, as seen in lines 18 and 19.

! If the argument is an rvalue, a move is performed. In this case, a new
! array is not created. This makes the move operation much faster.

This is evident in the main program.

! The std::move call on line 53 returns an rvalue, hence the assignment
! operator will move the data from account2 to account .

This is significantly more efficient than the copy assignment on line 48.
