Explanation #
In lines 42 â€“ 45, we have initialized an object of Account class, deposited
the amount 75.15 in the account, and withdrew 30.

We have called the getBalance() method in line 47, which returns the
balance left in the account. Note that this method is declared public .

By using the scope operator :: , we can access the variable publicly
declared in the class in line 48.
