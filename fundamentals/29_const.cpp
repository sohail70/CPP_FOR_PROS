Const

!The const keyword affects the behavior of a variable. Any variable initialized
!with the const keyword cannot be modified later on. It is constant.

const int i = 10;
i = 20; // "Error: Cannot modify a constant variable"

!Variables or attributes of a class that have been made using const must
!always be initialized.


!Class methods can also be const but they can only be invoked by const
!instances of the class.

Pointers #
!Both the pointer and the data being pointed to can be const .


type const* / const type* #
!This declaration implies that the value being pointed to is const . It should not
!be altered. However, the pointer itself is not const :

int i = 2011;
int const* ip = &i;
*ip = 2012; // ERROR
int j = 2012;
ip = &j; // ERROR: pointer being non-const


type* const #
!In this case, the pointer is constant. It cannot point to a different pointer
!throughout its lifetime.
int i = 2011;
int j = 2012;
int* const p = &i;
p = &j; // ERROR
*p = 2015; // ERROR: pointer being non-const

const type* const #
!Now, both the pointer and the value are constant.
int i = 100, int j = 200;
const int* const p = &i;
*p = i; // ERROR
p = &j; // ERROR

The line, const int* const p , should be read from right to left. p is a constant
pointer, * const points to an int that is const . We can modify i directly, but
we canâ€™t modify it through p .
