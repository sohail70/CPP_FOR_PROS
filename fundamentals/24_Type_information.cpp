TypeInformation


typeid #
!We have seen numerous instances of the typeid operator in this course. It can be used to retrieve the type of a variable or object at runtime. Because of this, it works well with pointers.
!To use typeid , we must include the <typeinfo> header. The operator returns a type_info object that has various methods of its own

Hereâ€™s how typeid can be used:
Circle c(5.0);
const std::type_info& t = typeid(Circle);
const std::type_info& v = typeid(c);

!Notice the & in the assignment operations. This specifies that this variable will be a reference to a type object. We must also make it const because each type has a single type_info instance associated with it.


type_info #
A type_info object stores information about a type. One useful feature is that
it allows two types to be compared using comparison operators.It can also tell us the name of the type through the name() method.

if (typeid(a) == typeid(b)){
    std::cout<<"a and b are of the same type";
}
std::cout << typeid(a).name() << std::endl;



The name is implementation-defined and must be the same for each variable
of the same type.
