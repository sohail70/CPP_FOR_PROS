Function Overloading

Definition #
Function overloading is the concept of affecting a functionâ€™s behavior
based on the number of parameters or their types.


! This way, functions with different parameters can coexist with the same
! name. Function overloading works with different parameters. The function
! prototype can change and the return type changes according to parameters
! being returned.

Types of arguments #
#include<iostream>
#include<string.h>

const char* min(const char* s , const char* t)
{
    return(strcmp(s,t)<0) ? s:t;
}
float min(float x , float y)
{
    return (x<y) ? x:y;
}

int main()
{
    const char* s = min("abc","xyz");
    float f = min(4.4f , 1.23f);
    int f2 = min(2011,2014);
    //float f3 = min("abc" , 1.23f);

    std::cout<<s<<"\n";
    std::cout<<f<<"\n";
    std::cout<<f2<<"\n";
}


The min function behaves differently based on the types of arguments
provided. We have defined it to handle const char* and float arguments.

! In line 14, the int arguments are implicitly converted to float and an error
! is not thrown. The result is again converted to an int to match the type of f2 .

! Line 15 would not work since the function prototype is not written to handle
! different types of arguments (i.e., the combination of strings, floats, and
! integers)

Increase the number of arguments #

#include <iostream>
#include <string.h>
float min(float x, float y){
    return (x < y) ? x : y;
}
float min(float x, float y, float z){
    return x < y ? (x < z ? x : z) : (y < z ? y : z);
}
int main() {
    float f = min(4.45F, 1.23f);
    float f2 = min(4.45f, 1.23f, 0.19f);
    std::cout << f << std::endl;
    std::cout << f2 << std::endl;
}



Now, the function can handle three float arguments as well. We can extend
this to as many as we want.



Rules for choosing the right function #
We need to search for a function with the exact type.
We need to apply type promotion to the arguments.
We need to convert arguments.


! Another thing to keep in mind is that the compiler ignores references when
! overloading functions. For example, min(int x, int y) is the same as min(int
! &x, int &y) .

! Furthermore, the const and volatile qualifiers are also ignored. min(int x,
! int y) is the same as min(volatile int x, volatile int y) . However,
! min(const int& x, const int& y) is a different overloading function as the
! const keyword applies to int but not to the reference property.

Why do we overload? #

In the end, we can always create functions to perform different operations.
But what would happen if we were running a large scale application that
needs to support a variety of similar functions?
It would be impractical to remember the names of all unique functions. By
overloading, we can introduce a great deal of simplicity and readability in our
code.
We only need to provide the appropriate arguments and the compiler will
handle the rest of the functionality.
